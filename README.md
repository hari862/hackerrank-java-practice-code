I have recently started practicing Java problem solving on HackerRank website.
https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java?badge_type=java

This Source code repository contains the solution for various problems mentioned in Java Practice set.

The class Names directly correspond to the exercise problem's name. 
Whenever multiple solutions are possible then there are different versions of the Class name is added e.g. if there is a problem of input reading from console and this could be solved by 1. Java.util.Scanner and 2. java.io.BufferedReader then there are 2 versions of solution made available as 1. EndOfFile.Java and 2. EndOfFileV2.java.

Happy Coding!
